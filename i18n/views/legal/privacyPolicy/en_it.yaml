    signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP
    address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.<br><br>

    Google uses this information on behalf of Box2box to analyze your use of the website, to generate reports on
    website activities and to provide Box2box with further services related to website and internet usage.
